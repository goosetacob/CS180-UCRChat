UCRChat
========


Overview
--------

In this project, we will develop a social networking app similar to LINE or WeChat.
With this app, users can add other users as friends and then chat with each other as well as post text, image, video, link like a microblog. It should also support group chat and video
call. There should be a timeline or moments page for users to see what their friends have posted and write comment or like.
Users can only chat with their friends and see their friends' posts.
